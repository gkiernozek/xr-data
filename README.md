## Brief documentation

This project is a Unity-based application that utilizes the Unity DOTS framework. It includes systems for graph point spawning and interaction, leveraging the Burst compiler for performance optimization.


## Scenes

- `Assets/_Project/Scenes/`
  - `Graph.unity`: Scene with just a graph subscene for faster interactions
  - `XR Graph.unity`: Scene with graph & xr rig

## Key scripts

- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Graph/Systems/`
  - `PointsSpawnSystem.cs`: Spawning points in the graph basing on GraphConfig data.
  - `GraphingSystem.cs`: Responsible for drawing graph points.
  - `GraphInteractionSystem.cs`: Handling graph interactions basing on XRInteractionPointsData.
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Graph/ComponentsAuthoring/`
  - `Coordinates.cs`: XZ coordinates for data points.
  - `GraphConfigAuthoring.cs`: Contains config for whole graph - dimensionSize, spacing, pointPrefab, graphPointsTransform.
  - `XRInteractionPointsData.cs`: Contains array of XRInteractionPoints positions served into ecs by XRInteractionPoints.
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Graph/XRInteractionPoints/XRInteractionPoints.cs`: connection between XR and ECS


## Other key files / folders / info

- `Assets/_Project/Assets/Materials` contains axis materials as well as a YShaderGraph used to visually render differen color gradient basing on Point height while maintaining single batch.
